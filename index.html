            <h2>What is a Science Exhibition? </h2>
            <div class="exhibition-container">
            
           <p>A science exhibition in a school setting is an organized event where students showcase their scientific projects, experiments, and models to their peers, teachers, parents, and sometimes even to the broader community. Itâ€™s an opportunity for students to demonstrate their understanding of scientific concepts through practical applications and creative presentations.
              A typical science exhibition features a range of exhibits covering various branches of science such as physics, chemistry, biology, environmental science, and technology. Projects can include working models, demonstrations, research findings, and innovative solutions to real-world problems.</p>
